## Description

My 'Finding similar items' project implementation for 'Algorithms for massive data' module of DSE program.

It aims to efficiently find similar books reviews from the [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews/data?select=Books_rating.csv).

## List of files

- `Project report.pdf` – Report with the description of work done.

- `stopwords.txt` – List of stopwords. Is used during the code execution.
- `found_pairs.csv` – Output file containing detected similar review pairs.
